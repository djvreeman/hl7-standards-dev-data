| [FHIR-38605](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-38605) | [http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ecdx/branches/Sept2022Ballot/background.html#steps-1](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ecdx/branches/Sept2022Ballot/background.html#steps-1) | re: "STU2 level of maturity, given STU1 was only published a few days prior to the public ballot period?"    STU is a ballot grouping or sequence and not an indication of maturity.  We will add maturity level indicators (FMM) to the guide.         re:  " how Payer systems associate attachments to and processes the claim or prior authorization is out of scope"    Clarify that the \_process how to associate the information\_ with the original Claim/PA is OOS, not the data needed for association which is documented in the IG. |

The current CDex design is flexible enough to support the current state of healthcare data \_and\_ \_optionally\_ \_provide additional granularity to\_ define \_POU\_ with a greater level of discrimination at the transaction level if and when it is implemented or required in the future.        |

The following:    "Attachments must also be compatible with the X12 N 837I and 837P for claims purposes and the 278 response for authorizations. Compatibility assumes that the appropriate identifiers are supported in the submission to facilitate association of the attachment with the claim submission or authorization request."      |

| [FHIR-38252](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-38252) |  | See FHIR-37738 , the US Core variance request,  for the rationale for not using the US Core Patient profile as a contained patient.  There is nothing prohibiting the contained patient from conforming to US Core Patient.  |
| [FHIR-38245](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-38245) |  | The attachments request is designed to be:   # compatible with x12 transactions (no explicit POU in the these transactions)   # the POU is implicit to be Payment related for a Pre-Auth or Claim. However, the attachments could also be used for other activities as well such as Quality Measures - in other words - Operations)    Adding a POU input parameter as an optional element to the attachment profile would provide the same benefit of being able to narrow the POU beyond TPO on a per-transaction basis.    Will add an \_optional\_ POU input parameter to the Attachment Profile as we did for the Task-based query profile. |

| [FHIR-38241](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-38241) |  | Currently, Support X12 as a baseline capability using the request model of LOINC attachment codes and the provider can submit a CCDA or PDF back.       We will align with DTR functionality and. provide the ability to address attachment data more precisely. CDex attachments will support the use of LOINC Document Type codes, particularly where X12 transactions are part of the interactions, and include the ability to use Questionnaire, CQL, and QuestionnaireResponse as supported by DTR when there is no transition into/out of X12 transactions in the interactions. This is achieved by including a URL to a FHIR Questionnaire in the request instead of a LOINC Document Type code. That approach will enable requests for very specific missing data, avoid a document format where not needed, yet still provides the ability to have a signature for the provider to attest to the content where that is required by a payer, which not all will require, nor require a document formatted attachment.  Technically will add an element for a URL to a FHIR Questionnaire and the provider responds by submitting the completed QuestionnaireResponse.    For Task-based queries it the same as above except the provider updates Task and references QuestionnaireResponse in the Task.output.     (Use the extension [http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaireresponse-signature] for signed responses)         For high-level summary see attached |

| [FHIR-38188](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-38188) |  | The requirement for signatures does not come from CDex, it comes from payers. CDex defines how the technical requirements are met.  The issues surrounding whether signatures are necessary/appropriate/useful are out of scope.    we will not explicitly discourage their use    However, we will clarify that the inclusion of signature specification does not advocate for their use:     "The IG specification supports the transmission of signatures if business agreement requires them but does not require them." |
