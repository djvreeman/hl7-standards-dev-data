A key area of focus in adding support for `granular permissions,` e.g. to provide access to resources at the category level in addition to the type level. This would allow apps to request narrower access, like `all vital signs` rather than `all observations.`

Enhancements and Clarifications to the SMART App Launch specification (see Jira change request [FHIR-30578](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30578) for a log  of changes included in the ballot):

- Clarification on launch context scope
- New scope syntax for granular permissions
- `POST`-based authorization
- Addition of PKCE to authorization requirements
- Profile token introspection
- Guidance for communicating permissions to end users
- Update discovery properties to support these changes.

Several new pages have been added to this version of SMART App Launch Implementation Guide. A new *Overview* page has been been added to introduce the reader to the guide. The *Backend Services* pages has been moved from [FHIR Bulk Data Access](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/) to consolidate the patterns for client authorization.  There are new pages to define two patterns for client authentication -*Asymmetric (public key)* and *Symmetric (shared secret)*.  The *Token Introspection* page documents how to support token introspection and there is and informative *Best Practices* page.  Finally, the  *Launch and Authorization* page has been extensively rewritten to make it clearer, and more reader friendly.",,,4.0.1,,,,,,,http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2,STU 2,,,

  This is the main entry page for access to the HL7 Terminology. This material comprises the Code Systems and Value Sets which are cited in HL7 Published artifacts (International Standards and Implementation Guides).  These pages also contain Concept Maps and Naming Systems defined and published by HL7, accessible here for the convenience of the implementation community.   There is also an option to download the terminology along with some additional components.
    
  As part of the HL7 approach to provide unified governance and support consistent access to the terminology and vocabulary that has been published for many years, all of the published Code Systems and Value Sets across all of the main HL7 Product families is intended to be accessible on these pages.   This includes Version 2, Version 3, CDA (base only), and FHIR.   Note that the full unification of all of the terminology content of HL7 Code Systems will be an ongoing effort.  
  
  The new HL7 process for governance and maintenance of the vocabulary published by HL7 is called 'UTG'; for more information see the documentation on the [UTG Project Page](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VMAH/Vocabulary+Maintenance+at+HL7). This process employs a community-wide, consensus-based, continuous process for updates to the terminology. Periodically, a snapshot of the terminology (which is verified to be internally consistent) will be taken as a new 'release' of the HL7 Terminology.   All such published releases will be accessible from these pages (see the table below).

  * The Major number indicates a new major release, and will be updated when significant new content is added, or there are substantial layout and formatting changes, or changes are being released which MAY break some backward compatibility.  The Minor number and Build number will be reset to zero whenever there is a new major release.  
  * The Minor number will be incremented on every release.  These will consist of one to many approved changes to the HL7 terminology.   Occasionally, it may coincide with other HL7 Standards releases for synchronization purposes. The Build number will be reset to zero on a new minor release.  
  * The Build number is used to count the number of changes implemented into the ci build. For releases it will almost always remain at zero, unless some errata for a serious issue or a technical correction is absolutely required.  This number will be incremented on the HL7 Terminology Continuous Integration (CI) build page with every new commit of changes and rebuild, and thus is important primarily on the continuous build page, linked below at (current).",,,,http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG,,,,"['hl7.terminology.r3', 'hl7.terminology.r4', 'hl7.terminology.r5']"

  The HL7 Terminology releases have a 3-part release version identifier, in the format of Major.Minor.Build.  
  * The Major number indicates a new major release, and will be updated when significant new content is added, or there are substantial layout and formatting changes, or changes are being released which MAY break some backward compatibility.  The Minor number and Build number will be reset to zero whenever there is a new major release.  
  * The Minor number will be incremented on every release.  These will consist of one to many approved changes to the HL7 terminology.   Occasionally, it may coincide with other HL7 Standards releases for synchronization purposes. The Build number will be reset to zero on a new minor release.  
  * The Build number is used to count the number of changes implemented into the ci build. For releases it will almost always remain at zero, unless some errata for a serious issue or a technical correction is absolutely required.  This number will be incremented on the HL7 Terminology Continuous Integration (CI) build page with every new commit of changes and rebuild, and thus is important primarily on the continuous build page, linked below at (current).",,,,http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0,Publications,,,"['hl7.terminology.r3', 'hl7.terminology.r4', 'hl7.terminology.r5']"

With 45% of Medicare beneficiaries requiring post-acute care (PAC) services after hospitalization, the need for a seamless exchange of health information is great.

In 2014, the Social Security Act was amended to include the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act, which required the standardization and interoperability of patient assessment in specific categories for post-acute care (PAC) settings, including long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), home health agencies (HHAs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). It focuses on standardizing data elements in specified quality measure domains and patient assessment domains for cross setting comparison and clinical information exchange, respectively. The Act requires:

* Reporting of standardized patient assessment data through commonly used PAC assessment instruments for LTCHs, SNFs, HHAs, and IRFs
* Minimum Data Set (MDS) for SNFs
* Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility – Patient Assessment Information (IRF – PAI) for IRFs
* LTCH Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE) Data Set (LCDS) for LTCHs
* Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for HHAs
* Implementation of data elements specified in each assessment domain using standardized data elements to be nested within the assessment instruments currently required for submission by LTCH, IRF, SNF, and HHA providers
* Data to be standardized and interoperable to allow exchange of data between PAC providers, among others, using common standards and definitions to provide access to longitudinal information and facilitate coordinated care.

 - changed to AuditEvent profiling leveraging [Basic Audit Log Patterns (BALP) Release 1.1.0](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/index.html)
   - changes to RESTful type, and query subtype
 - Added new features
   - Add an [Generate Metadata](1332_actor_options.html#13325-generate-metadata-option) that adds the [ITI-106](ITI-106.html) operation that allows for one structured/coded document to be published.
     - Is the use of Operation preferrable to the Simplified Publish?
   - Add an [Simplified Publish](1332_actor_options.html#13324-simplified-publish-option) option that allows for one DocumentReference with the document in the .data element to be published, expecting the Document Recipient to create the SubmissionSet derived off of the DocumentReference and Community mapping policy.
   - Add an [ITI-65 FHIR Documents Publish](1332_actor_options.html#13326-iti-65-fhir-documents-publish-option) option with support in ITI-65 to include a FHIR Document Bundle as an alternative to Binary. This makes less the burden on the Document Source to seralize the content into an appropriate Binary format, as that requirement is moved to the Document Recipient. There are use-cases where the Document Recipient will use the FHIR Document Bundle directly, and there are requirements on the Document Recipient to seralize the FHIR Document Bundle when grouped with non-FHIR Actors like XDS/XDR/XDM.
     - This is added as an option at this time to keep base compatibility with existing MHD. This may become normal functionality of ITI-65 eventually
   - Each of these new options may survive or may be removed. Please voice your interest, and sign up for IHE-Connectathon to test these options. Based on interest these Options may survive or be removed.
 - better clarity on types of Identifier
 - a method has been added to support DocumentReference replace that is used by the Document Source to mark the old/replaced DocumentReference instance as superseded.",,,4.0.1,,,"## The IHE Mobile Access to Health Documents (MHD)

It will also provide the flexibility to compare interim progress at different times during the contract performance period, in addition to notifying providers of non-clinical pre-defined events that may have a direct effect on financial performance and ultimately success.",,,,http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-vbpr/2023Sep,STU1,,,

The CodeSystems FSIII, FFB, FBOE and CareSocialCodes have been migrated from FK-klassifikation (ExTest) May and June 2023. The version of each CodeSystem has been set to the date of the actual migration. 
FBOE is released in its initial version.
FSIII has been updated with §140 and §119 interventions with detailed concepts for when interventions are delivered individually or in a group. A number of headings in FSIII classic have changed display e.g. H4 changed from SEL § 84 stk. 2 to Midlertidigt ophold. Notice that FSIII classic uses its legacy codes e.g. H1, rather than the new uuid from FK-klassifikation. This is to preseve the implementations already relying on the legacy codes.
FFB has changed term from Omgivelsesfaktorer to Omgivelser for 7445fb2b-0009-43d9-b49b-1b9782f2fcd9. The new concept a56d59c0-c8fd-468c-85f9-b67f66561b90 Omgivelsesfaktorer has been added.
CareSocialCodes have been updated with reasons for stopping an intervention, see 2c059407-fed5-4852-92d8-6bb5ad63d7bb Begrundelse for indsatsophør and its subtype descendants. In addition the term Rehabilitering efter § 140 have been changed to Genoptræning efter §140, and two subtypes have been added.
